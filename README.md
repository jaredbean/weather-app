# Weather Web App
A single-page web app that displays the weather for a given city.

This app allows the user to enter either a 'city' or 'city, country code' to lookup the current weather. If the city is found, the name of the city is displayed with an image representing the current weather. The data displayed includes: Temperature in farenheit, humidity, pressure, and wind speed in mph. If the city cannot be found, an error message is displayed.

This app was created using [Microsoft's new Blazor technology](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) allowing front-end development using C#. The app also uses the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data.
